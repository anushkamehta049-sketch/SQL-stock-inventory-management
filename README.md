# SQL-stock-inventory-management
Stock Inventory Management System using SQL – A database-driven project that tracks products, suppliers, inventory levels, and transactions while generating insights on revenue, demand, and supplier performance using SQL queries.
Stock Inventory Management System (SQL Project)

Efficient inventory management is a critical challenge in modern business environments such as retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing. Traditional manual inventory systems often result in stock mismanagement, revenue loss, delayed restocking, and limited visibility into real-time data.

This project implements a Stock Inventory Management System using SQL, demonstrating how structured databases and analytical queries can be used to manage inventory operations efficiently and support data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Project Objectives

Manage products, categories, suppliers, and inventory levels

Track purchases, sales, and stock movements

Monitor low-stock items and reorder requirements

Analyze revenue, product demand, and supplier dependency

🗂️ Database Design

The system is built using multiple relational tables:

Products – Stores product details such as category, price, and supplier

Suppliers – Manages supplier information and sourcing relationships

Inventory – Tracks stock levels, availability, and movements

Transactions – Maintains purchase and sales history with revenue data

🔍 SQL Concepts & Techniques Used

Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

Subqueries and filtering conditions

JOIN operations across multiple tables

GROUP BY and HAVING clauses

Date-based analysis and conditional queries

📊 Business Insights Generated

Total number of products and suppliers

Active customers who made purchases

Category-wise product distribution

Low-stock products below reorder level

Monthly purchase analysis (e.g., Feb 2025)

Top-selling and high-revenue products

High-value customers and orders

Supplier-wise purchase volume

Above-average customer purchase behavior

✅ Conclusion

This project showcases how SQL can be effectively used to manage and analyze inventory data in a real-world business scenario. By transforming raw transactional data into meaningful insights, the system helps businesses:

Prevent stockouts and overstocking

Optimize supplier relationships

Improve sales and marketing strategies

Enhance profitability and operational efficiency

The Stock Inventory Management System highlights the power of SQL in building scalable, efficient, and insight-driven inventory solutions.
